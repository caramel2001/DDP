## Paper Grpah

- Paper Topic Classification based on Computer Science Ontology (CSO) available <a href ="https://cso.kmi.open.ac.uk/download/version-3.3/cso_v3.3.csv">here</a>

  - Consists 14K topics and over 163K relationships
  - First, it can characterise higher-level research areas by means of hundreds of sub-topics and related terms, which enables to map very specific terms to higher-level research areas.
  - With the help Klink-2 algorithm combines semantic technologies, machine learning, and knowledge from external sources to automatically generate a fully populated ontology of research areas.
