From 2008 to 2009, he worked as a Member of Consulting Staff in CoWare R&D, Noida, India. From 2010 to 2014, he led the MPSoC Architectures Research Group in RWTH Aachen, Germany as a Junior Professor. Since September, 2014, Anupam was appointed as an Assistant Professor in SCSE, NTU, where he got promoted to Associate Professor with Tenure from August, 2019. In the past, he held visiting positions at Politecnico di Torino, Italy; EPFL, Switzerland; Technion, Israel and Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata.During his doctoral studies, he worked on automatic RTL generation from the architecture description language LISA, which led to a spin-off, and subsequently was acquired by a leading EDA vendor. He developed novel high-level optimisations, verification techniques, and proposed a language-based modelling, exploration and design framework for partially re-configurable processors - many of which resulted in successful technology transfers to the EDA and Semiconductor IP industry. Anupam currently heads a team of 20+ researchers, overseeing projects in the area of computer architectures, security, design automation and emerging technologies. His research advances has been reported in more than 100 conference/journal papers (ACM/IEEE/Springer), multiple research monographs and edited books (CRC, Springer) and open-access forums. Together with his doctoral students, Anupam proposed novel research directions like, domain-specific high-level synthesis for cryptography, high-level reliability estimation flows for embedded processors, generalisation of classic linear algebra kernels and multi-layered coarse-grained reconfigurable architecture. Anupam’s research in the area of emerging technologies has been covered by major news outlets across the world, including Asian Scientist, Straits Times and The Economist.Anupam regularly serves in the TPCs of top conferences, reviews journal/ conference articles and presented multiple invited seminars/tutorials in prestigious venues. He is a series editor of Springer book series on Computer Architecture and Design Methodologies. He is a member of ACM and a senior member of IEEE.Anupam received Borcher's plaque from RWTH Aachen, Germany for outstanding doctoral dissertation in 2008, nomination for the best IP award in the

Before joining SCSE, he held a visiting position at the Alibaba-NTU Singapore Joint Research Institute. Prior to that, he was a Senior Research Scientist at Baidu Research USA from 2018 to 2019, and a Research Scientist and Group Leader at Disney Research Pittsburgh from 2015 to 2017. He received his Ph.D. degree in Computer Science from Georgia Institute of Technology in 2014, and his B.Eng. degree from Nanyang Technological University in 2008. He published more than 45 peer-reviewed papers in top-tier journals and conferences, and holds two US patents. His research work has been covered by influential technology media outlets such as Engadget, TechCrunch, New Scientist, and National Public Radio.","My research interests lie in Computational Narrative Intelligence, Multimodal Learning, and Machine Learning. Narrative Intelligence is a central cognitive ability and a hallmark of human intelligence. I believe that in order to simulate human intelligence, artificial intelligence must first acquire human-level knowledge from an approximation of the human experience, which is inherently multimodal. Further, inspired by the observation that human intelligence emerges from the interaction of multiple cognitive processes, I am interested in understanding the interactions between different neural network components and developing techniques that coordinate the learning of different neural network components beyond simplistic stochastic gradient descent.","['Computational Narrative

We are developing tools for vulnerability modeling and detection using machine learning and (both static and dynamic) program analysis on binary code. In our Securify research project (2015 - 2020), we are performing formal verification on security system from hardware, hypervisor, programs to security protocol using different verification approaches. Recently, we embark on the research on Automotive Security and autonomous vehicle Security in their security design, runtime security monitoring and response, and also the security testing and certification.For software engineering, we are working on the topics related to program specification learning and model learning, performance analysis, Android energy analysis, reliability analysis, code clone analysis, program debugging, program testing, automatic loop analysis, testing and validating deep learning algorithms using techniques like model checking, symbolic execution and machine learning. We are building tools related to these aspects. For Android system, we have been working on security analysis on App malware detection & classification, generation and data analytic, App vulnerability analysis, App testing, Android OS testing and fuzzing, and Automatic UI generation.For multi-agent systems, we are working on the topics related to formal modeling of various multi-agent systems, particularly trust management systems and their analysis in correctness, security and robustness.For big data, we are promoting the concept called event analytic based on behavior learning and analysis, and their applications in sports and finance systems.","['2019 University Leadership Forum Chair in Computer Science and Engineering', 'A Framework for Intellectual Property Protection of Deep Learning Applications', 'Building Security Tools for

He joined NTU as a Distinguished University Professor in August 2022, and will take up the appointment of Vice President (Research) in January 2023. Prior to joining NTU, he was Professor of Computer Science at the University of Oxford; Fellow of Merton College, Oxford; Honorary Professor of Computer Science, Bristol University; Shaw Visiting Professor at National University of Singapore; and Prize Research Fellow, Trinity College, Cambridge.","Professor Ong's research is broad, ranging across semantics of computation, programming languages, verification, logic and algorithms, and algorithmic game theory. A notable feature of his work is the combination of ideas and methods from semantics and structures, with techniques from automated verification. Professor Ong is one of the leading figures and inventors of game semantics and its applications. His solution (with Hyland) to the PCF Full Abstraction Problem opened up the field of game semantics; and their constructions, known as Hyland-Ong games, have become standard notions in the semantics of programming languages. Professor Ong is also known for his pioneering contribution in the field of verification: his LICS 2006 paper co-initiated higher-order model checking, a new branch of algorithmic verification that combines ideas and methods from semantics with automata-theoretic and allied techniques in automatic verification, with applications to the verification of higher-order programs. His current research interests include computer and cyber security, higher-order logic and satisfiability modulo theories, and probabilistic and differentiable programming. Throughout his long stay in Oxford, Professor Ong has supervised well over 60 doctoral students and postdocs. His contributions to the advancement of computer science have been recognised with leadership positions in major scientific conferences and bodies. Professor Ong was General Chair (2013-2015) of the ACM / IEEE Logic in Computer Science (LiCS), and Founding Vice Chair (2014-2019) of the ACM Special Interest Group in Logic and Computation. He was founding Steering Committee Chair (2015-2018), Formal Structures for Computation and Deduction. He has served as programme chair and on the steering committees of leading scientific meetings, including ACM / IEEE LiCS, European Association of Theoretical Computer Science, European Association of Computer Science Logic, and European Joint Conferences on Theory and Practice of Software. Ong has given numerous keynote presentations and invited lectures, including well over 100 at international research meetings.Professor Ong has received several international and national accolades. He is the joint winner of the ACM / EATCS / EACSL / KGS Alonzo Church Award 2017 for Outstanding Contributions to Logic and Computation. He is also a recipient of the President of the Republic of Singapore Scholarship in 1981, Prime Minister’s Book Prize in 1980, Overseas Merit Scholarship from 1981 to 1984.",['Bayesian Statistical

He is also a member of the IEEE Technical Committee on Computational Finance and Economics. He has constantly and sucessfully groomed several high calibre research manpower who are awarded prestigious Singapore Millenium Foundation Scholar and Fellowships, Lee Kuan Yew Fellowship and A*Star Scholarhips.","His main interests includes the research and study of brain-inspired functional and computational models of memory structures that underlie the human reasoning process. In addition, advanced brain-inspired reasoning and cognition frameworks such as focus of attention, affect modeling, skill learning from novice to expert are actively investigated using the neurocognitive informatic approach. Fuzzy, Fuzzy neural, Neural, GA, GA-Neural, Rough set that maps formal fuzzy logical structures onto neural systems to perform fuzzy set derivation and Rule identification/reduction are investigated. The development of architectures that supports on-line and off-line learning fuzzy intelligent rule based systems is examined. The research issues cover fuzzy clustering, learning, modeling, fuzzy rule model, etc. These basic techniques are used to craft the brain-inspired memory learning systems. These memory learning structures are the building blocks of the functional neuro-cognitive brain and they can be broadly classified into huppocampal global semantic memories and neocortical like semantic association memories. In addition, research into CMAC and in-house developed MCMACs and Fuzzy MCMACs are actively pursued. They form a class of cerebellar like association memories that have excellent memory resolution and recall. The application areas are extensive as they rely heavily on the basic research into brain-inspired learning memory structures and brain-inspired cognitive architectures for emotion, cognition and perception modeling. The exciting application areas include computational finance ? arbitration, portfolio, trend analysis, bond and commodity trading; biomedical engineering ? diabetes modeling and control, ICU ventilator control; Affect modeling for edutainment, forensic tools, marketing research tools; Medical decision support tools ? thermograph analysis, pediatric leukemia and ovarian cancer analysis; Intelligent transportation analysis tools ? trend analysis and incident monitoring; as well as student affect modeling in Intelligent Tutoring System.",['Data Analytics and Complex Systems

Sourav’s core research expertise is in data management, human-data interaction, and data analytics. He is more excited to solving problems not within the mainstream of these fields that require new perspectives instead of yet another solution to a traditional problem. Consequently, his research interests are multi-area (e.g., data management and HCI, data management and IR) and multi-disciplinary (e.g., system biology and data analytics, social psychology and data analytics, cognitive psychology and data management, abstract art and social analytics, adult learning and data management) in flavor, focusing primarily on developing novel paradigms, algorithms, technology, and software to improve efficiency of software as well as humans. Sourav has published more than 100 papers in top-tier data management, data mining, multimedia, bioinformatics, and systems biology venues such as ACM SIGMOD, VLDB, ACM WWW, ACM MM, ACM SIGIR, VLDB Journal, Bioinformatics, and Biophysical Journal. The common thread running through his research is a focus on going beyond papers to build usable novel prototypes. He has received Best Paper Awards at ACM CIKM 2004 and ACM BCB 2011 for papers related to evolution mining and biological network summarization, respectively. His work on influence maximization was nominated for the best paper award in SIGMOD 2015. He has co-authored books on “Summarizing Biological Networks” and “Human Interaction with Graphs”, which are published by Springer-Verlag (May 2017) and Morgan & Claypool (August 2018) publishers, respectively. His research is supported by over S$4M in research grant from the Singapore-MIT Alliance and the Ministry of Education (4 Tier 2s, 6 Tier 1s). Sourav's research has been deployed in the real-world. His XML data management framework for biological data was part of the product of a local startup HeliXense Pte Ltd in 2002. More recently, his data-driven conflicts of interest (COI) detection system called CLOSET is being used by several premium conferences. Sourav regularly serves as a reviewer for premium data management and data analytics conferences (e.g., SIGMOD, VLDB) and journals (e.g., TODS, VLDB Journal). He has served/serving as a program chair/co-chair of several venues including ACM CIKM 2020, IEEE BigComp 2018, DASFAA 2014. He has also served/serving as Group Leader (area chair) for VLDB 2022, SIGMOD 2021, ICDE 2021, and SIGMOD 2019. He is a member of the steering committee of DASFAA. Sourav has been panelist, tutorial and keynote speaker in several international conferences (including SIGMOD, VLDB). He has also been reviewer of external Ph.D dissertations, national and international grant proposals, and external tenure applications. He is a member of the editorial boards of several international journals (e.g., IEEE TKDE, JASIST, SIGMOD Record). He is a co-recipient of the ""VLDB Service Award"" in 2018 from the VLDB Endowment for his contribution in designing an efficient PVLDB proceedings management framework. He is also conferred ""Distinguished PVLDB2020 Review Board Member Award"" in 2020 for ""outstanding services to VLDB 2020 and data management community"". Sourav have strong interest and passion for teaching undergraduate and graduate students. He was nominated for the Excellence in Teaching Award in 2020, 2005, 2004, and 2003. He was recipient of Lecturer of the Year Award (2002-2003) for Year 1 undergraduate course.

Then he joined NTU as an Assistant Professor and was promoted to Associate Professor in 2015. From 2017-2018, he was appointed as Tan Chin Tuan Exchange Fellowship, New York University. He was also an Adjunct Fellow, Singapore Institute of Manufacturing Technology (SIMTech), A*STAR, from 2020-2021. His papers have been published by top journals and conferences and won several best paper awards. Jie Zhang is also active in serving research communities.","Jie Zhang's research work is in the area of User Modeling, one of the important subareas of Artificial Intelligence. It has been focused on providing personalized recommendations to users on which others to interact with (e.g., do business with or acquire information from), by modeling: 1) the trust (i.e., reliability, capability and honesty) of the others; and 2) the preferences of the users. Dr. Zhang has made significant contributions to both trust modeling and preference modeling. More interestingly, for accurately modeling trust, he has specifically taken good care of user preference (subjectivity); for accurately modeling preference, he has well leveraged the trust
